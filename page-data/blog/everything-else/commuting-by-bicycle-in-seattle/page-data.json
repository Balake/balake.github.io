There are hills, cars, and it rains 9\nmonths out of the year. Those are not the friendliest conditions for a bicycle. Driving usually\nfeels safer, drier, and faster.\n\nI'm sure you're aware of the benefits of cycling as well: physical activity, smaller carbon\nfootprint, no parking fees, etc. So if the safety of cycling compared to driving, dryness, and speed\nof cycling as a commute option can be addressed, then there should be no reason why we can't all be\ncommuting by bicycle!\n\n## Why listen to me?\n\nYou don't have to! But hear me out. I've been commuting by bicycle for about 4 and a half years now.\nI'm no veteran commuter, but I have had plenty of time to make changes to my process and a couple of\nopportunities to explore. I'll first go over my commuting history, which should give some context\nfor how I've come up with the guidelines I've listed below.\n\n## Brief history\n\n### First time commuting\n\nThe first time I commuted by bicycle was back in 2021. My office hadn't issued any form of RTO\n(return to office) just yet, but my job required some interaction with hardware on premise. I lived\nonly 4 miles away, but in terms of driving time, that was about 20-30 minutes on a good day. While\nnot a bad driving commute, I had a hunch that cycling could be faster. It wasn't. I didn't know what\nroutes to take besides what Google Maps told me. I felt like I was mostly dodging cars and hoping I\ndidn't get hit for 30 minutes.\n\n![4 mile Strava route](/images/commute_4_mile_strava_map.png)\n\nOver time, I adjusted my route to roads that had less traffic, like neighborhood greenways and safe\nstreets. I gradually got faster and felt safer. I think one of my best times in was just 14 minutes.\nWith higher safety comes confidence and speed.\n\n### Moving\n\nI moved in 2024 and my commute went from 4 miles one way to 11 miles. Quite the jump! This brought\nquite a few challenges as my time to commute was over an hour. I applied some of the same techniques\nthat I learned with my shorter commute and got to a place where my commutes were approaching the 40\nminute mark.\n\n![11 mile Strava route](/images/commute_11_mile_strava_map.png)\n\n### New job\n\nIn April of 2025, I started my new job, yay! With this, my commute was updated to 7 miles one way.\nLuckily, about 6 of those miles were on the same route, but that didn't stop me from iterating and\ncontinuing to improve. You'll notice that the beginning of my route has changed despite most of the\nroute being the same. I'll get into why down below.\n\n![7 mile Strava route](/images/commute_7_mile_strava_map.png)\n\n## How?\n\nOkay, so there are three main facets that I think are important to commuting by bicycle for both\nsafety and speed. The main facet is the route.\n\n### Routing\n\nWhen it comes to routing, there's only so much you can do by looking at a map. When I'm coming up\nwith a new route, the first place I look is the most obvious: Google Maps. Google's cycling route\ndata is usually quite good and will often route you on bike friendly paths. This is a good place to\nget your initial route.\n\nOnce you have your initial route, the best thing to do is ride it! There are some questions at the\nback of your head that you should be looking to answer:\n\n1. How much traffic is there?\n2. Are there physical barriers between vehicles and cyclists?\n3. Are there other cyclists on parts of this route?\n4. Is this route physically possible for you?\n\nOnce you have a solid baseline answer to those questions, you can start to make alterations or\nexplorations to optimize your route.\n\nAs an example, part of my initial route included a 3 mile stretch of\n[Healthy Street](https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/programs/healthy-streets).\nWhat I learned though is that traffic was _bad_ on this street. Not all of it, but a good chunk of\nit. Turns out that the nearby school meant that parents were driving down this road to drop off\ntheir kids. I changed my route to go a couple blocks over, parallel to the Healthy Street and no\nmore traffic!\n\nAnother example is my initial 11 mile route included what is known on Strava as the\n[West Seattle Wall](https://www.strava.com/segments/710020). Let me tell you: this hill is steep. I\ndreaded it every time as it was at mile 9 of 11. I _could_ do it, but it made me not want to\ncommute, that's for sure. Luckily, there were some alternatives at the cost of some more distance,\nbut one ended up being about equal for time, so I made the switch.\n\n### Attention\n\nThe second facet to safe and speedy commuting by bicycle is paying attention. I know that sounds\nsimple, but it really is important. One thing that people often don't realize is part of paying\nattention is _listening_. You can't see behind you unless you have mirrors and often times, you'll\nhear a car or pedestrian before you see them. This is why I highly discourage the use of headphones\nor even the bone conducting listening devices.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\" title=\"Double check for danger!\">\n  A pro tip here is to always double check for danger. There have been times where I look one way to\n  cross a road, then look the other, and by the time I'm looking forward again, the first direction\n  I looked is no longer safe because of a speeding vehicle. Really make sure that the direction\n  you're traveling is safe.\n</Callout>\n\nOne final tip about paying attention is traffic lights.\n[Leading pedestrian interval (LPI)](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/proven-safety-countermeasures/leading-pedestrian-interval)\nis a good opportunity to get out in front of vehicles that are looking to turn. Often times drivers\nwill jump at a green light, but if you're already in the intersection, you're much more likely to be\nseen.\n\nI can go on about interacting with vehicles, but that deserves its own post to be honest. Moral of\nthe story is never trust any driver.\n\n### Gear\n\nLast but not least, the third facet of safe and fast commuting is bicycle gear. First of all, the\nbike! You don't need a carbon road bike to commute. You want something that is reliable, but most\nimportantly, _comfortable_. Comfort should be the utmost priority when selecting a bicycle. If your\nbike isn't comfortable, you're not going to want to ride it. This typically means a proper bike\nfitting at your local bike shop if you're unsure of what to look for. I haven't mentioned e-bikes,\nbut they are a great way to make your ride more comfortable.\n\nClothes are also something to consider. Can you change at work easily? Are you the type of person\nthat wants to shower? Most importantly, wear clothes that keep you dry, because dry means\n_comfortable_, and I mean dry in terms of rain and sweat. I have found personally that fishing sun\nshirts and a rain shell work for almost every scenario.\n\n<Callout type=\"tip\" title=\"Lights\">\n  Get some lights! Even if it's not dark, cycling lights significantly increase your chances of\n  being seen. I recommend taking a look at some of the lights that [Fenix\n  Lighting](https://www.fenixlighting.com/collections/bike-lights) makes, as they are high quality\n  and have easily replaceable, rechargeable batteries.\n</Callout>\n\nLastly, I recommend at least a bike rack for your work belongings. I was the guy with a backpack for\na couple years, but decided to get a rack one hot summer day and haven't looked back. Your spine and\nlumbar muscles will thank you.\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nCommuting by bicycle in Seattle is a lot of fun. Health benefits aside, you'll be polluting less,\nand supporting others that commute simply by being out there. The city of Seattle\n[collects data](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/Departments/SDOT/About/DocumentLibrary/Reports/2024_Traffic_Report.pdf)\non the number of cyclists and the more there are, the more allocation of resources goes towards\ncycling infrastructure.\n\nHappy commuting!\n\n\\- Blake, bicycling commuter\n","fields":{"timeToRead":{"minutes":6.715,"text":"7 min read","time":402900,"words":1343}},"frontmatter":{"title":"A not so complete guide to commuting by bicycle in Seattle","description":"My first non-tech post!
