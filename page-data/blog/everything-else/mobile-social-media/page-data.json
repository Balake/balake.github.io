I've never been\nthe kind of social media person that posts frequently or has specific community use cases for social\nmedia, so why would I remove these apps from my phone? Maybe a better question to start is why would\nI have them in the first place?\n\n## Installed social media\n\nI'm going to go through the social media apps that I had installed and what my original motivations\nwere for installing them in the first place.\n\n### 1. Facebook\n\nI think this might be the \"oldest\" social media that I had. We remember the days of seeing what our\nfriends and family were up to or thinking and I think that's part of the reason that I still had the\nFacebook app installed. Features like groups or marketplace I have found quite useful over the\nyears. I'm a frugal person so buy/sell groups, buy nothing groups, and marketplace have been\nbastions of my monetary personality.\n\n### 2. YouTube\n\nYouTube videos have been part of my life for as long as I can remember YouTube existing. Much of my\ncareer and hobby knowledge was learned on YouTube and many of the DIY skills I have had their\ninception with YouTube. From cars to household tasks to homelabbing, YouTube has content out there\nfor learning anything. Some of my favorite non-educational content creators are on YouTube as well.\nI've watched many hours of content on video games I never intended on playing simply because these\ncreators are fun to watch. YouTube has been a staple for me.\n\n### 3. Reddit\n\nTo the detriment of my mental health, Reddit was a good place to get news quickly for things\nhappening around the world. I liked the idea of curated groups or topics of news and so Reddit drew\nme in. Of course Reddit isn't a news source itself, but by being an aggregate for news, you often\nsee a full range of publishers being posted. Reddit is not primarily a news app though. There are\nmany awesome communities out there for all other purposes.\n\n### 4. Instagram\n\nPhotography is one of the few art forms that I've been consistently interested in. Instagram was\noriginally a great place to find inspiration and learn new things from. Many of my favorite wildlife\nphotographers I found on Instagram first.\n\n![Socials](/images/removing-social-media/excalidraw_socials.png)\n\n## Why remove them?\n\nSomething that is clear after listing those out is that each of those social medias have been used\nas a form of education, even Facebook with some of the groups that I've joined over the years, like\nthe Sony Alpha group for photography. Social media over the years has become engineered to maximize\nour attention. Out of the four above, three have introduced short form video content and have placed\nit front and center within these platforms.\n\nShort form video content is one of the more effective ways of maximizing attention on these apps.\nWe've all been there: opened up Instagram to spy on one of our friends and 30 minutes of reels\nlater, we forgot why we opened the app in the first place.\n\nThe other way that social media maximizes on attention is that \"fringe\" content is algorithmically\npromoted because those edgy forms of content produce the highest amount of engagement. Outrageous,\ncrazy, borderline via the content policy: all good for engagement.\n\n![Content](/images/removing-social-media/excalidraw_content.png)\n\nAll of this to say: I have to fight for my attention any time I open any of these apps. Is this an\nissue of willpower or focus? I don't think so as I've heard the same from others. I think a better\nquestion though is why do I need to see these things on my phone? Just because I can doesn't mean I\nshould. Much of the content I've mentioned is better consumed on a larger screen anyway. So why?\nConvenience? Fear of missing out? I actually don't know. Probably convenience, probably FOMO, but\nalso easy access to dopamine.\n\nI think I can try and come up with other justifications all day, but really I had these apps\ninstalled subconsciously as easy dopamine hits and I know I'm not alone. I had become desensitized\nto anything and everything having to do with social media, so I required more and more to satiate\nthese impulses. This had adverse effects in _real_ life too. These platforms are marvels of human\nengineering and I just felt out of control; a constant impulse to reach for my phone, continuous\nguilt, and overall anxiety. I could never feel present in any moment.\n\nI can summarize the reason for removing **all** my social media apps as: I wanted to be in control\nagain.\n\n## What I expected to happen\n\nBy removing these apps, what did I expect? To be honest, I expected a sense of relief. Relief from\nconstantly having the urge to reach for my phone. Relief from getting sucked into content I had no\nintention of viewing. And relief from feeling guilty for spending so much time on my phone when I\nwanted to do other things.\n\n![Expectations](/images/removing-social-media/excalidraw_expectations.png)\n\nI wish I had screenshots of my screen time from back then, but iOS only allows you to view screen\ntime about four weeks back. I believe it averaged about 4-5 hours a day, so I also expected my\nscreen time to go down.\n\nAnother thing that I expected was for me to become less informed about what's going on. I like being\nin the know, whether that's tech related, political, or any other areas of interest or importance.\nHow much of the content I was consuming contributed to this though? I didn't really have an answer\nand going forward, measuring this is tough as well.\n\n## What actually happened\n\nRemoving these apps was incredibly easy. They were gone in less than a minute. What followed was not\neasy. Immediately I had this intense feeling of \"now what?\" I wouldn't call this feeling boredom,\nbut more of a void. An attention void? For the next few days, I was constantly reaching for my\nphone, despite knowing there was nothing there for me to check.\n\nMy attention to things in real life did not get better. I did not get a sense of relief like I was\nexpecting, the opposite actually: a sort of anxiety around being left out, not knowing what to do,\nand not knowing how to combat my compulsions that were not waning. This continued for a couple weeks\npretty consistently. I've heard of dopamine detoxes and I think this is similar. I don't think there\nreally is a replacement behavior for social media.\n\nHowever, after the three week mark, I started to notice myself reaching a _bit_ less for my phone.\nAt about this time too, I started checking [npr.org](npr.org) a couple times a day as a news source.\nThis helped a tad and NPR isn't a firehose of news, so checking more than once or twice a day is\nkind of pointless and their \"timeline\" is chronological so once you've seen something, you don't get\nmore content.\n\nI found that my focus streaks started to get a _bit_ longer, maybe 10-20% longer which was\npreviously an order of single digit minutes at best, so a minor improvement, but noticeable. The\nanxiety that I mentioned above was still there, but had decreased a _bit_ as well. Still no relief.\nMy screen time had been reduced quite a bit which is something that I had anticipated.\n\nI also found myself with nothing to do frequently. And what I mean by that is I wouldn't be on my\nphone, but I didn't have anything else _to do_. Of course I have projects and other things that I\nwant to work on, but none of those felt like they could fill the void. I've unfortunately picked up\na mobile game, which feels like a regression, but I didn't feel guilty about it. I would rather that\nbe my crux than social media and I'm confident it's something I can easily address in the future.\nThis still hadn't filled the void, but I noticed that feeling of _needing_ something to do waning.\n\n![Nothing to do](/images/removing-social-media/excalidraw_nothing-to-do.png)\n\n## Where I'm at today\n\nWas all of this for naught? I mentioned a bit of improvement around three weeks and guess what? That\nimprovement continued. I can easily focus now for at least ten minutes without reaching for my\nphone. The urge is still there, but I feel in control finally. My anxiety around needing to check\nsocial media and that void feeling has dropped considerably, albeit not gone.\n\n![Graph of anxiety](/images/removing-social-media/excalidraw_social-media-anxiety.png)\n\nAnother interesting side effect of this process is that my mentality towards online content,\nespecially short form, has increasingly gotten more negative. Before I thought the issue was just\nme, but now I have clarity into the issue being much more systemic and I have a feeling of repulsion\ntowards these contents. I think this is akin to going sugar free where afterwards, the sweet stuff\nactually tastes bad.\n\nI expected to become less informed and that is the one thing that I did get right. I still follow\nsome news as I mentioned above, but the articles are limited and broad in scoped compared to some of\nthe more specialized subreddits that I had been visiting. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad\nthing yet, so time will tell.\n\nI've mentioned FOMO a few times and to be honest, I've missed a _tiny_ amount of what my friends and\nfamily are posting and that's it. Turns out, I wasn't really seeing much of those posts anyway in\nthe sea of sponsored content.\n\nI never got that sense of relief. Relief is usually coupled with a noticeable and immediate change,\nwhich I got, but relief wasn't the outcome. My screen time did decrease by about 50% which is proof\nof how much time I was spending on social media, about 2-3 hours a day! As I mentioned before, I\nbelieve I traded some time with some a mobile game, so that's something that will need to be\naddressed if I want to get my screen time to a minimum.\n\n![Screen time now](/images/removing-social-media/screen_time.jpg)\n\n## What I would do differently\n\nIf I were starting this over I would do a few things differently:\n\n1. Have something ready to fill the attention void, like a book. Preferably something you enjoy\n   already.\n2. Set up your \"intentional device\" ahead of time so you don't miss out on things that are important\n   to you. _Note: be careful with this though!_\n3. Do this with someone else to hold each other accountable.\n\n## What the future looks like\n\nI want to introduce social media back into my life slowly, but not on my phone. Some of the utility\nthat I had originally gained from these platforms I'm still looking for. One thing that I've been\nexperimenting with in my life is what I like to call \"intentional devices\". That deserves its own\npost, but the idea is that we can leverage devices for what they are good at and originally intended\nfor. I can use my laptop for most things that I wanted originally from social media. Even better, I\ncan use some free tools to tailor my experience to exactly what I want. For example: I can use\n[Social Focus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/socialfocus/) on Firefox (available on\nother browsers) to hide the things I don't care about on Facebook. That's the power of using a\nbrowser as your entry point. I'm now able to use Marketplace without any of the distractions on the\nway in.\n\n_Example of most things removed from Facebook sidebar:_\n![Facebook with side bar options removed](/images/removing-social-media/facebook.png)\n\n## Closing thoughts\n\nUltimately, my journey is not over. Do I still reach for my phone? Yes. Do I still feel FOMO?\nAbsolutely. Is my anxiety better or worse than when I started? Better, but it was _worse_ for a few\nweeks. Do I regret removing social media from my phone? Not at all.\n\nI can't recommend this process enough. Everyone should do it. Take control of your attention and\nyour time. Your time is your life. Don't let these big companies rob you of your time and data.\n\n**\\- Balake, liberated from social media**\n","fields":{"timeToRead":{"minutes":10.26,"text":"11 min read","time":615600,"words":2052}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mobile social media: the purge","description":"Some thoughts on my motivation for removing social media from my phone and what the effects have been","date":"2025-11-03"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f1cbf569-4401-519f-829d-5e9144e00d58","frontmatter":{"title":"Mobile social media: the purge","date":"2025-11-03","description":"Some thoughts on my motivation for removing social media from my phone and what the effects have been","tags":null}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
