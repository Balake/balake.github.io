I've been around the sun a few times at this point and I've learned a lot\nin my short time as a SWE lad (6.5 years as of writing this). Much of what I've learned was from\nothers, both in person and through the internet. What I want to do with this blog is to give back a\nbit and document some of the problems that I've solved or found interesting.\n\nWe've all been there: it's 12:30am and you still can't find the answer that you're looking for.\nCrapGPT is running in circles. You rearrange your search terms _just a tad_ and the search ghouls\nserve up some different results. Some you've clicked on, some you haven't. One that you haven't\nclicked on yet has generic domain like github.io. Maybe it's a blog? You decide to enter and yes! A\nblog! The more you read, the more you think you've got a lead on the issue. Does it have a ton of\nfluff? Maybe. Does the blog post solve your issue? No, but it points you in a direction finally that\ngives you a different error. That's the kind of tech blog I want to have.\n\n# Sooooo... how?\n\nThere are some technologies that I know from my time as a SWE: React and Markdown. I _really_ like\nMarkdown, and so many applications that I use allow for Markdown so being able to write in Markdown\nis a strict requirement. React I can take it or leave it, but I certainly don't want to write\ncontent in React. Finally, I would like to learn something new.\n\nThose very loose requirements leave a few (non-exhaustive) options:\n\n- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)\n  - Easy to set up\n  - Easy to add content\n  - Styled with themes\n- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)\n  - Not easy to set up, requires build system\n  - Easy to add content once system is in place\n  - Can by styled with tailwindcss\n- [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)\n  - Easy to set up\n  - Easy to add content\n  - Costs $8 a month as of writing this, subject to pricing changes\n- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)\n  - Easy to set up\n  - Easy to add content\n  - Familiar Obsidian flows\n\nWith those options being considered, it seems like Eleventy or Quartz are the winners. They are! But\nnaturally, I went with the most difficult option purely to build and learn something: Gatsby.\n\n### Gatsby stack\n\nIf you're not familiar with how Gatsby works, it's basically just a static React frontend that uses\nGraphQL to source content. That content is then built into React components. It supports a vast\nplugin ecosystem that allows for adding support to all sorts of features.\n\nAs of writing this post, my Gatsby setup includes:\n\n- MDX (markdown, but support for inline React components)\n- Code syntax highlighting via [prismjs](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism#readme)\n- [Mermaid graph support](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)\n- Typescript\n- UI components from [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)\n\nWas it easy to set up? No, BUT I did learn quite a bit about some things I have never used before\nlike shadcn and tailwind, so I don't feel bad about these choices.\n\n## Where's the boilerplate?\n\nI haven't got any, sorry. I call this the \"learn and cry\" stack. One day maybe I'll put up a base\nproject template somewhere, but today is not that day. My recommendation for using a similar setup\nas mine is to work through the issues yourself. If you want a good to go setup, then I suggest some\nof the other options above.\n\nI also have a weird setup in that I want to have two blogs essentially. I want to be able to post\nabout hobbies and other things in life that are not tech related. You know, things to show your\nfriends and family that indicate that I'm doing something other than staring at my laptop all during\nworking hours and then going home and doing the same thing until I go to bed.\n\nMy abnormal setup is mine and mine alone!! Just kidding, as I was writing this, I got side-tracked\nand pushed up the template, but modified to not be two pieces. Here it is:\n[gatsby-mdx-ts-tailwind-template](https://github.com/Balake/gatsby-mdx-ts-tailwind-template). This\nis probably the best way for me to share rather than too many code snippets here. As a proof that I\n_can_ do code snippets though, here's one! This is the auto generation of posts which are then\naccessible via their respective links:\n\n```typescript\nexport const createPages: GatsbyNode[\"createPages\"] = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter }) => {\n  const result = await graphql<{\n    posts: { nodes: Post[] };\n  }>(`\n    query Posts {\n      posts: allMdx(\n        filter: { internal: { contentFilePath: { regex: \"/posts/\" } } }\n        sort: { frontmatter: { date: DESC } }\n      ) {\n        nodes {\n          frontmatter {\n            title\n            date\n          }\n          internal {\n            contentFilePath\n          }\n          id\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  `);\n\n  if (result.errors) {\n    reporter.panicOnBuild(\"Error loading MDX result\", result.errors);\n  }\n  if (!result.data) {\n    reporter.panicOnBuild(\"No MDX result data\", result.errors);\n    return;\n  }\n  const posts = result.data.posts;\n\n  posts.nodes.forEach((node) => {\n    actions.createPage({\n      path: getSlug(node.internal.contentFilePath),\n      component: `${path.resolve(\"./templates/post.tsx\")}?__contentFilePath=${\n        node.internal.contentFilePath\n      }`,\n      context: {\n        id: node.id,\n      },\n    });\n  });\n};\n```\n\n## Deployment\n\nHaven't actually done this yet, but I think I can just\n[deploy to Github pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/),\nso that's what I'm going to attempt to do. If you're reading this, that means I succeeded in\ndeployment somehow.\n\nUpdate: deployment success. I was able to also get auto deploys working! I ran into some issues with\nusing a modern version of `yarn`, but was able to get around it. Below is the snippet for my\nautomatic deployments:\n\n```yaml\nname: Gatsby Publish\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      # Setup Node.js (LTS)\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: \"lts/*\"\n\n      # Enable Corepack for Yarn Plug'n'Play and use project yarn version\n      - name: Enable Corepack and Use Project Yarn Version\n        run: |\n          corepack enable\n          corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate\n          yarn --version\n\n      # Deploy using Gatsby GH Pages Action\n      - uses: enriikke/gatsby-gh-pages-action@v2\n        with:\n          access-token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}\n          deploy-branch: main\n          deploy-repo: \"balake.github.io\"\n```\n\n# What's next?\n\nMy plan is to get my [everything else namespace](/blog/everything-else) up and running. I have some\nmore ideas on what I want to write for this tech namespace as well.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\\- Balake, blog beginner\n","fields":{"timeToRead":{"minutes":5.17,"text":"6 min read","time":310200,"words":1034}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Making this site!","description":"My first tech post!
